## Development

Worked in a team with 3 engineers, each tasked with a seperate module of the product page. We each built our own full stack module, including our own databases, which we populated with fake user data. We connected all the modules together using a proxy server.

Project was built as the frontend capstone at Hack Reactor.

## Technologies

- ReactJS, Express, Node, MongoDB
- Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Chai
