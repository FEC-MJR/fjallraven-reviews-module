## Development

Worked in a team with 3 engineers, each tasked with a seperate module of the product page. We each built our own local MongoDB to store data to populat our modules. Once our modules were complete we combined them using a proxy server also but with Express and Node.

Project was built as the frontend capstone at Hack Reactor.

## Technologies

- ReactJS, Express, Node, MongoDB
- Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Chai
